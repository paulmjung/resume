<p>My name is Paul Jung and I'm a learning and development professional with a passion for high tech.</p>
<p>I've designed, developed, and delivered countless application and performance-based trainings over nearly a decade in the industry across a variety of platforms: instructor-led classroom training, knowledge articles, eLearnings, and virtual/distance training.</p>
<p>My job is to clarify the complex and make it simple. I take my job seriously.</p>

<h4><strong>Target</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Senior Business Partner - Instructional Design (November 2014 - March 2015)</strong></p>
<p>My role as an instructional designer required me to imagine, plan, and manage the development of learning experiences that were effective and appropriate for a given audience. Through research, interviews, and observation, I was better able to understand what would (or wouldn't) work well for clients and design the solutions accordingly. I was also responsible for making sure the end products that were developed remained true to my design and on schedule.</p>

<p>Results include:
  <ul>
    <li>Utilized ADDIE model to design meaningful, effective learning experiences for a variety of audiences.</li>
    <li>Designed for the needs of the modern learner, resulting in content that is clear, concise, and appropriately challenging.</li>
    <li>Partnered with in-house development team to manage creation of sophisticated and unique training deliverables.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Senior Business Partner - Learning & Development (August 2013 - November 2014)</strong></p>
<p>Promoted to Senior Business Partner role to support and satisfy critical needs within the organization. Through direct interaction and consulting with client groups in eCommerce and IT Security, I was able to diagnose the unique training needs of each group, and, in turn, recommend, design and develop solutions that were effective and appropriate.</p>

<p>Results include:
  <ul>
    <li>Quickly assessed training needs and created unique training solution to improve employee performance and skills in wake of significant organizational change; comparison of pre- and post-training surveys yield 25% improvement in rates of both satisfaction and topic awareness.</li>
    <li>Designed security training for all levels of the organization with hands-on guidance and support from Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).</li>
